# Whole-Body Humanoid MPC

This repository contains a Whole-Body Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) for humanoid loco-manipulation control. This approach enables to directly optimize through the **full-order torque-level dynamics in realtime** to generate a wide range of humanoid behaviors building up on an [extended & updated version of ocs2](https://github.com/manumerous/ocs2_ros2)

**Interactive Velocity and Base Height Control via Joystick:**

It contains the following hardware platform agnostic MPC fromulations:

### Centroidal Dynamics MPC
The centroidal MPC optimizes over the **whole-body kinematics** and the center off mass dynamics, with a choice to either use a single rigid 
body model or the full centroidal dynamics. This specific approach builds up on the centroidal model in ocs2 by generalizing costs and constraints to a 6 DoF contact among others. I am still working on documenting this. Until then a conscise explanation of the ocs2 centroidal model can be found here [Sleiman et. al., A Unified MPC Framework for Whole-Body Dynamic Locomotion and Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00946)

### Whole-Body Dynamics MPC
The **whole-body dynamics** MPC optimized over the contact forces and joint accelerations with the option to compute the joint torques for 
each step planned accross the horizon. I am still working on documenting and publishing the approach. The most relevant information on the choosen approach can currently be found in [Galliker et al., Bipedal Locomotion with Nonlinear Model Predictive Control:
Online Gait Generation using Whole-Body Dynamics](http://ames.caltech.edu/galliker2022bipedal.pdf)
### Robot Examples

The project supports the following robot examples:

- Unitree G1
- 1X Neo (Comming soon)

## Get Started

### Setup Colcon Workspace

Create a colcon workspace and clone the repository into the src folder:

```bash
mkdir -p humanoid_mpc_ws/src && cd humanoid_mpc_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/1x-technologies/wb-humanoid-mpc.git
```

Then initialize all submodules using:

```bash
cd wb-humanoid-mpc
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
### Install Dependencies
The project supports both Dockerized workspaces (recommended) or a local installation for developing and running the humanoid MPC. 

<details>
<summary>Build & run Dockerized workspace in VS Code</summary>

We provide a [Dockerfile](https://github.com/manumerous/wb_humanoid_mpc/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile) to enable running and devloping the project from a containerized environment. Check out the [devcontainer.json](https://github.com/manumerous/wb_humanoid_mpc/blob/main/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) for the arguments that must be supplied to the `docker build` and `docker run` commands.

For working in **Visual Studio Code**, we recommend to install the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension. Then, with the root of this repository as the root of your VS Code workspace, enter `Ctrl + Shift + P` and select `Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container` at the top of the screen. VS Code will then automatically handle calling the `docker build` and `docker run` commands for you and will reopen the window at the root of the containerized workspace. Once this step is completed, you are ready to [build and run the code](https://github.com/manumerous/wb_humanoid_mpc/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#building-the-mpc).

</details>

<details>
<summary> Build & run Dockerized workspace with bash scripts</summary>

This repository includes two helper scripts: `image_build.bash` builds the `wb-humanoid-mpc:dev` Docker image using the arguments defined in `devcontainer.json`. `launch_wb_mpc.bash` starts the Docker container, mounts your workspace, and drops you into a bash shell ready to build and run the WB Humanoid MPC code. Example of building docker image:
```
cd /path/to/humanoid_mpc_ws/src/wb_humanoid_mpc/docker
./image_build.bash
```
and launching the docker container:
```
cd /path/to/humanoid_mpc_ws/src/wb_humanoid_mpc/docker
./launch_wb_mpc.bash
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Install Dependencies Locally</summary>

Make sure you have **ros2** installed on your system as e.g specified for jazzy in
the [installation guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html).

Then install all dependencies using:

```bash
envsubst < dependencies.txt | xargs sudo apt install -y
```
</details>


### Building the MPC 

Building the WB MPC consumes a significant amount of RAM. We recommend saving all open work before starting the first build. The RAM usage can be adjusted by setting the PARALLEL_JOBS environment variable. Our recommendation is:

| PARALLEL_JOBS | Required System RAM |
|--------------:|--------------------:|
| 2 (default)   |  16 GiB             | 
| 4             |  32 GiB              |
| 6             |  64 GiB              | 


```bash
make build-all
```

## Running the examples
Once you run the NMPC a window with Rviz will appear for visualization. The first time you start the MPC for a certain robot model the auto differentiation code will be generated which might take up to 5-15 min depending on your system. Once done the robot appears and you can control it via an xbox gamepad or the controls in the terminal. 

On the top level folder run:

For the **Centroidal Dynamics MPC**

```
make launch-g1-dummy-sim
```

For the **Whole-Body Dynamics MPC**

```
make launch-wb-g1-dummy-sim
```

#### Interactive Robot Control
Command a desired base velocity and root link height via **Robot Base Controller GUI** and **XBox Controller Joystick**. For the joystick it is easiest to directly connect via USB. Otherwise you need to install the required bluetooth Xbox controller drivers on your linux system. The GUI application automatically scanns for Joysticks and indicates whether one is connected.
